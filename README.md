# Optimization of Agricultural Irrigation on Dry Land Using IoT Automation Based on Fuzzy Logic

This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of agricultural irrigation systems, especially on dry lands in Indonesia, which traditionally rely on low-efficiency conventional methods (only 40-60%). The research aims to address this issue by utilizing **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology combined with **Fuzzy Logic** to create a real-time automated irrigation system that monitors soil moisture and temperature. The system controls water sprinklers connected to a central water tank, ensuring optimal and even water distribution.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Sensors are used to measure soil moisture and temperature continuously, ensuring that plants get just the right amount of water.
- **Automated control**: The system automatically activates sprinklers based on sensor data, optimizing irrigation and minimizing water waste.
- **Water efficiency**: This system increases water usage efficiency by up to **95%**, significantly reducing waste compared to conventional irrigation systems.
- **Cost-effective**: Reduces both operational costs and labor requirements.
- **Increased crop yield**: The system ensures that crops receive proper irrigation, leading to better yields.
- **Sustainable agriculture**: Supports sustainable farming practices by conserving water and optimizing resource use.

## Research Findings

The research shows several key improvements in agricultural practices:
- **Water usage efficiency**: The IoT-based system improves water distribution by up to 95%, compared to only 40-60% in conventional systems.
- **Cost reduction**: The automation significantly reduces labor and operational costs.
- **Higher productivity**: Consistent and optimized irrigation leads to better crop yields.
- **Environmental sustainability**: Prevents over-irrigation and promotes responsible water use, contributing to long-term agricultural sustainability.

## System Architecture

The system is built around a network of sensors that monitor soil moisture and temperature. The data is processed using Fuzzy Logic, which determines the amount of water needed and controls water pumps and sprinklers accordingly. This system ensures an efficient irrigation process, conserving water and boosting crop yields.
