# Optimization of Agricultural Irrigation on Dry Land Using IoT Automation Based on Fuzzy Logic

This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of agricultural irrigation systems, especially on dry lands in Indonesia, which traditionally rely on low-efficiency conventional methods (only 40-60%). By leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Fuzzy Logic, we developed a real-time automated irrigation system that monitors soil moisture and temperature through sensors. This system controls water sprinklers connected to a central water tank, ensuring efficient and even water distribution across the field.

The results of our research show that this IoT-based irrigation system can improve water usage efficiency by up to 95%, significantly reducing water waste compared to conventional systems. The system also lowers operational costs, reduces labor requirements, and increases crop yields, contributing to sustainable farming practices.
